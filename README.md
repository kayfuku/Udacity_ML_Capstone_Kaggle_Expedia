### Capstone Project 

This project is my final project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, and is based on the Kaggle competition, [Expedia Hotel Recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations#description). This competition is about a hotel search application that provides personalized hotel recommendations for its users. The customer data will be used to predict which types of hotels people are going to book. 

Machine Learning libraries, such as [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [mlxtend](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) are used in this project. I should note that input data is not included, but may be downloaded from the competition site [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data).
