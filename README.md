### Capstone Project 

This project is my final project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, and is based on the Kaggle competition, [Expedia Hotel Recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations#description).
I should note that input data is not included, but may be downloaded from the competition site [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data).
